      "message": "- PNF stretching, also known as neuromuscular stretching, involves actively contracting the target muscle before passively stretching it for enhanced flexibility.\n- To combine PNF techniques with your daily exercise routine, you can follow these steps:\n  - Actively contract the muscle you want to stretch for 7–15 seconds.\n  - Then, passively stretch the muscle for 20–30 seconds.\n  - Repeat this process one to three times for each muscle group.\n  - Make sure to tailor the hold times and intensity based on your individual needs and response to the stretching. \n\nSource PDF:\n\n**files\\NASM-CES.pdf**\n**files\\NSCA-CPT.pdf**"
